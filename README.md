Epsilon-Delta
=============

Allows you to do basic epsilon delta proofs.
For a description on notation and what epsilon delta proofs, I recommend reading chapters 1 and 2 of these [notes] 
(http://www.math.toronto.edu/tholden/LectureNotes137_Preview.pdf).

For now, you can do any n\*x+c or n\*x\*\*2, where n and c are natural numbers. 
Coming soon are n\*x + c, n\*x -c, and n\*x\*\*2 +/- c, for n and c in the set of real numbers, along with a built in (online) epsilon delta proof tutorial, and general proof structure.

Enjoy!
