Epsilon-Delta
=============
Website coming soon!!

Allows you to do basic epsilon delta proofs.
For a description on notation and what epsilon delta proofs, I recommend reading chapters 1 and 2 of these [notes]
(http://www.math.toronto.edu/tholden/LectureNotes137_Preview.pdf).

For now, you can do any n\*x &plusmn; c or n\*x\*\*2 &plusmn; c, where n and c are natural numbers.
Coming soon are proofs w/ all real numbers and trig functions! yay!


Enjoy!
